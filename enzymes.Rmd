# Enzymes

[Enzymes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme) are macromolecular biological catalysts. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.

Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds.  Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH.

Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.

In this laboratory, we will study the effect of temperature, concentration and pH and on the activity of the enzyme catalase. Catalase speeds up the following reaction:

2 H~2~O~2~ -> 2 H~2~O + O~2~

Hydrogen peroxide is toxic. Cells therefore use catalase to protect themselves. In these experiments, we will use catalase enzyme from potato.

The first experiment will establish that our catalase works (positive control) and that our reagents are not contaminated (negative control).

Hydrogen peroxide will not spontaneously degrade at room temperature in the absence of enzyme. When catalase is added to hydrogen peroxide, the reaction will take place and the oxygen produced will lead to the formation of bubbles in the solution. The height of the bubbles above the solution will be our measure of enzyme activity (Figure \@ref(fig:contr)).

##  Positive and negative controls (Experiment 1)
### Experimental procedures

2.	Then to **Tube 1**
    *   Add 1 ml of potato juice (catalase) to tube 1 (use a plastic transfer pipette).
    * Add 4 ml of hydrogen peroxide to tube 1. Swirl well to mix and wait at least 20 seconds for bubbling to develop.
    * Use a ruler and measure the height of the bubble column above the liquid (in millimeters; use the centimeter scale of the ruler) and record the result in Table \@ref(tab:control).
3. Then to **Tube 2**
    * Add 1 ml of water.
    * Add 4 ml of hydrogen peroxide. Swirl well to mix and wait at least 20 seconds.

2. Discard the empty tubes and other waste in the regular waste basket.
3. Rinse the glass rod and glassware with water and detergent.
4. Return the glass ware to the trays on your bench where you originally found them.
