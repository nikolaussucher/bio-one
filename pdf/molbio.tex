\chapter{Molecular Biology}\label{molecular-biology}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology}{Molecular
biology} concerns the molecular basis of biological activity between
biomolecules in the various systems of a cell, including the
interactions between DNA, RNA, and proteins and their biosynthesis, as
well as the regulation of these interactions.

One of the most basic techniques of molecular biology to study protein
function is molecular cloning. In this technique, DNA coding for a
protein of interest is cloned using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
and/or restriction enzymes into a plasmid (expression vector). A vector
has 3 distinctive features: an origin of replication, a multiple cloning
site (MCS), and a selective marker usually antibiotic resistance.
Located upstream of the multiple cloning site are the promoter regions
and the transcription start site which regulate the expression of cloned
gene. This plasmid can be inserted into either bacterial or animal
cells. Introducing DNA into bacterial cells can be done by
transformation via uptake of naked DNA, conjugation via cell-cell
contact or by transduction via viral vector. Introducing DNA into
eukaryotic cells, such as animal cells, by physical or chemical means is
called transfection. Several different transfection techniques are
available, such as calcium phosphate transfection, electroporation,
microinjection and liposome transfection. The plasmid may be integrated
into the genome, resulting in a stable transfection, or may remain
independent of the genome, called transient transfection.

DNA coding for a protein of interest is now inside a cell, and the
protein can now be expressed. A variety of systems, such as inducible
promoters and specific cell-signaling factors, are available to help
express the protein of interest at high levels. Large quantities of a
protein can then be extracted from the bacterial or eukaryotic cell. The
protein can be tested for enzymatic activity under a variety of
situations, the protein may be crystallized so its tertiary structure
can be studied, or, in the pharmaceutical industry, the activity of new
drugs against the protein can be studied.

\section{DNA restriction digest}\label{dna-restriction-digest}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_phage}{Lambda DNA} comes from
a virus
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage}{bacteriophage}) that
infects bacteria. This virus does not infect humans and is therefore
safe source to work with. Lambda DNA is approximately 48,000 base pairs
long.

When restriction enzymes are used to cut DNA fragments of varying sizes
are produced. Cut DNA can be separated using a process known as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel_electrophoresis}{agarose
gel electrophoresis}. Agarose gel electrophoresis separates DNA
fragments by molecular weight. DNA fragments are loaded into an agarose
gel slab, which is placed into a chamber filled with a conductive buffer
solution. A direct current is passed between positive (red) and negative
(black) wire electrodes at each end of the chamber. DNA fragments are
negatively charged, and when placed in an electric field will be drawn
toward the positive pole (red). The matrix of the agarose gel acts as a
molecular sieve through which smaller DNA fragments can move more easily
than larger ones. Therefore, the distance and rate at which DNA
fragments migrate through the gel is inversely proportional to its
molecular weight. Over a period of time smaller fragments will travel
farther than larger ones. Fragments of the same size stay together and
migrate in discrete ``bands''.

\section{Preparing a gel for agarose gel
electrophoresis}\label{preparing-a-gel-for-agarose-gel-electrophoresis}

We will use gel electrophoresis to separate the DNA fragments obtained
from the restriction digest (Figure \ref{fig:box}). Before setting up
the digest, we will pour agarose gel because it will take about half an
hour for the gel to harden.
