\chapter{Enzymes}\label{enzymes}

\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme}{Enzymes} are macromolecular
biological catalysts. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are
called substrates and the enzyme converts the substrates into different
molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell
need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain
life. Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual
steps. Enzymes are known to catalyze more than 5,000 biochemical
reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic
RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity
comes from their unique three-dimensional structures.

Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its
activation energy. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate
to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is
orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would
otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds. Chemically,
enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical
reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes
differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme
activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules
that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that
increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme
inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal
temperature and pH.

Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of
antibiotics. Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical
reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein,
starch or fat stains on clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer break
down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.

In this laboratory, we will study the effect of temperature,
concentration and pH and on the activity of the enzyme catalase.
Catalase speeds up the following reaction:

2 H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} -\textgreater{} 2
H\textsubscript{2}O + O\textsubscript{2}

Hydrogen peroxide is toxic. Cells therefore use catalase to protect
themselves. In these experiments, we will use catalase enzyme from
potato.

The first experiment will establish that our catalase works (positive
control) and that our reagents are not contaminated (negative control).

Hydrogen peroxide will not spontaneously degrade at room temperature in
the absence of enzyme. When catalase is added to hydrogen peroxide, the
reaction will take place and the oxygen produced will lead to the
formation of bubbles in the solution. The height of the bubbles above
the solution will be our measure of enzyme activity (Figure
\ref{fig:contr}).
