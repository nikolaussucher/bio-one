\chapter{Mendelian Genetics}\label{mendelian-genetics}

In this experiment, we will use maize \emph{Zea mays} subsp. mays, from
Spanish: maíz after Taíno mahiz), also known as corn to study
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance}{Mendelian
inheritance}. This cereal grain was first domesticated by indigenous
peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk of
the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or
ears, which are fruits, yielding kernels or seeds. Maize has become a
staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing
that of wheat or rice. However, not all of this maize is cnsumed
directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn
ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and
corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod
corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.

The principles of Mendelian inheritance were named for and first derived
by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel}{Gregor Johann
Mendel}, a nineteenth-century Moravian monk who formulated his ideas
after conducting simple hybridisation experiments with pea plants
(\emph{Pisum sativum}) he had planted in the garden of his monastery.
Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel cultivated and tested some 5,000 pea
plants. From these experiments, he induced two generalizations which
later became known as Mendel's Principles of Heredity or Mendelian
inheritance (Table \ref{tab:mendel}). He described these principles in a
two-part paper, Versuche über Pflanzen-Hybriden (Experiments on Plant
Hybridization), that he read to the Natural History Society of Brno on 8
February and 8 March 1865, and which was published in 1866. Mendel's
conclusions were largely ignored by the vast majority of scientists at
the time. In 1900, however, his work was ``re-discovered'' by three
European scientists, Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von
Tschermak.

Mendel discovered that, when he crossed purebred white flower and purple
flower pea plants (the parental or P generation), the result was not a
blend. Rather than being a mix of the two, the offspring (known as the
F1 generation) was purple-flowered. When Mendel self-fertilized the F1
generation pea plants, he obtained a purple flower to white flower ratio
in the F2 generation of 3 to 1. In the first experiment, we will examine
the F2 generation resulting from the F1 generation obtained from a
parental generation of yellow and purple corn.

He then conceived the idea of heredity units, which he called
``factors''. Mendel found that there are alternative forms of
factors---now called genes---that account for variations in inherited
characteristics. For example, the gene for flower color in pea plants
exists in two forms, one for purple and the other for white. The
alternative ``forms'' are now called alleles. For each biological trait,
an organism inherits two alleles, one from each parent. These alleles
may be the same or different. An organism that has two identical alleles
for a gene is said to be homozygous for that gene (and is called a
homozygote). An organism that has two different alleles for a gene is
said be heterozygous for that gene (and is called a heterozygote).

Mendel hypothesized that allele pairs separate randomly, or segregate,
from each other during the production of gametes: egg and sperm. Because
allele pairs separate during gamete production, a sperm or egg carries
only one allele for each inherited trait. When sperm and egg unite at
fertilization, each contributes its allele, restoring the paired
condition in the offspring. This is called the Law of Segregation.
Mendel also found that each pair of alleles segregates independently of
the other pairs of alleles during gamete formation. This is known as the
Law of Independent Assortment. In the second experiment, we will observe
this law exemplified by a dihybrid cross of corn.

The genotype of an individual is made up of the many alleles it
possesses. An individual's physical appearance, or phenotype, is
determined by its alleles as well as by its environment. The presence of
an allele does not mean that the trait will be expressed in the
individual that possesses it. If the two alleles of an inherited pair
differ (the heterozygous condition), then one determines the organism's
appearance and is called the dominant allele; the other has no
noticeable effect on the organism's appearance and is called the
recessive allele. Thus, in the example above the dominant purple flower
allele will hide the phenotypic effects of the recessive white flower
allele. This is known as the Law of Dominance but it is not a
transmission law: it concerns the expression of the genotype. The upper
case letters are used to represent dominant alleles whereas the
lowercase letters are used to represent recessive alleles.

\section{Punnett square}\label{punnett-square}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punnett_square}{Punnett square}
(Figures \ref{fig:punnett} and \ref{fig:punnettF1}) is a visual
representation of Mendelian inheritance and used to predict an outcome
of a particular cross or breeding experiment. It is named after
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Punnett}{Reginald C.
Punnett}, who devised the approach. In our first experiment, both
parents are homozygous, one carrying two copies of the dominant allele
(R), the other two copies of the recessive (r) allele. Each parent can
only make gametes that have either the R (purple) or r (yellow) allele.
The Punnett square for the parental cross is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:punnett}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/mendel/Punnett}

}

\caption{Punnett square for homozygous cross.}\label{fig:punnett}
\end{figure}

The squares containing the single letters represent the possible
gametes. The squares with two letters represent the zygotes resulting
from the combination of the respective gametes. It can be easily seen
that all offspring will be heterozygous (Rr) and therefore purple. The
Punnett square for the F1 cross is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:punnettF1}

\section{Monohybrid cross (Experiment
1)}\label{monohybrid-cross-experiment-1}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monohybrid_cross}{monohybrid
cross} is a mating between two individuals with different variations at
one genetic trait of interest. The character(s) being studied in a
monohybrid cross are governed by two or multiple variations for a single
locus. A cross between two parents possessing a pair of contrasting
characters is known as monohybrid cross. To carry out such a cross, each
parent is chosen to be homozygous or true breeding for a given trait
(locus). When a cross satisfies the conditions for a monohybrid cross,
it is usually detected by a characteristic distribution of
second-generation (F2) offspring that is sometimes called the monohybrid
ratio.

Generally, the monohybrid cross is used to determine the dominance
relationship between two alleles. The cross begins with the parental (P)
generation. One parent is homozygous for one allele, and the other
parent is homozygous for the other allele. The offspring make up the
first filial (F1) generation. Every member of the F1 generation is
heterozygous and the phenotype of the F1 generation expresses the
dominant trait. Crossing two members of the F1 generation produces the
second filial (F2) generation. Probability theory predicts that three
quarters of the F2 generation will have the dominant allele's phenotype.
And the remaining quarter of the F2s will have the recessive allele's
phenotype. This predicted 3:1 phenotypic ratio assumes Mendelian
inheritance.

In the first experiment, we will study the result obtained from a
monohybrid cross. A strain of corn producing pure purple kernels (RR) is
crossed with a strain producing pure yellow kernels (rr). Purple is
dominant with the resulting F1 ears all bearing purple kernels. These
plants that are heterozygous for a single trait are called monohybrids.
When the F1 is self-pollinated, the resulting F2 ears bear both purple
and yellow kernels (Figure \ref{fig:monohybrid}).

\section{Dihybrid cross (Experiment
2)}\label{dihybrid-cross-experiment-2}

In the second experiment, we will study the result obtained from a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihybrid_cross}{dihybrid cross}. A
dihybrid cross is a cross between two different lines (varieties,
strains) that differ in two observed traits. In the name ``Dihybrid
cross'', the ``di'' indicates that there are two traits involved (in our
example designated R and Su), the ``hybrid'' means that each trait has
two different alleles (in our example R and r, or Su and su), and
``cross'' means that there are two individuals who are combining or
``crossing'' their genetic information. In our example, a pure strain of
corn producing purple-starchy kernels (RR SuSu) is crossed with a pure
strain producing yellow-sweet (rr susu). The starchy seeds are smooth,
the sweet seeds are wrinkled. The resulting F1 ears all bear
purple-starchy (smooth) kernels. Plants that are heterozygous for two
traits are called dihybrids. When the F1 is self-pollinated, the
resulting F2 generation contains various combinations (Figure
\ref{fig:dihybrid}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{./figures/mendel/Dihybrid_cross}

}

\caption{Dihybrid cross}\label{fig:dihybrid}
\end{figure}

The rules of meiosis, as they apply to the dihybrid, are codified in
Mendel's first law and Mendel's second law, which are also called the
Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, respectively
(Table \ref{tab:mendel}). For genes on separate chromosomes, each allele
pair showed independent segregation. If the first filial generation (F1
generation) produces four identical offspring, the second filial
generation, which occurs by crossing the members of the first filial
generation, shows a phenotypic (appearance) ratio of \textbf{9:3:3:1},
where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the \textbf{9} represents the proportion of individuals displaying
  both dominant traits
\item
  the first \textbf{3} represents the individuals displaying the first
  dominant trait and the second recessive trait
\item
  the second \textbf{3} represents those displaying the first recessive
  trait and second dominant trait
\item
  the \textbf{1} represents the homozygous, displaying both recessive
  traits.
\end{itemize}

\section{Blood Typing (Experiment 3)}\label{blood-typing-experiment-3}

In this experiment, we will determine the ABO properties of four

\caption{Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the
ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.}\label{fig:type}
\end{figure}

A \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type}{blood type} (also
called a blood group)
(\href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ABO_blood_type.svg}{Figure
\ref{fig:type}}) is a classification of blood based on the presence and
absence of antibodies and also based on the presence or absence of
inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).
These antigens may be proteins, carbohydrates, glycoproteins, or
glycolipids, depending on the blood group system. Some of these antigens
are also present on the surface of other types of cells of various
tissues. Blood types are inherited and represent contributions from both
parents. A total of 35 human blood group systems are now recognized by
the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT). The two most
important ones are ABO and the RhD (``Rhesus'') antigen; they determine
someone's blood type (A, B, AB and O, with +, - or Null denoting RhD
status).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Using the dropper vial, place a drop of the first synthetic blood
  sample in each well of the blood-typing slide (Figure
  \ref{fig:typing}). Replace the cap on the dropper vial. Always replace
  the cap on one vial before opening the next vial, to prevent
  cross-contamination.
\item
  Add a drop of synthetic anti-A (blue) to the well labeled A. Replace
  the cap.
\item
  Add a drop of synthetic anti-B serum (yellow) to the well labeled B.
  Replace the cap.
\item
  Add a drop of synthetic anti-D (Rh) serum (clear) to the well labeled
  Rh. Replace the cap.
\item
  Using a mixing stick of a different color for each well (blue for
  anti-A, yellow for anti-B, white for anti-Rh), gently stir the
  synthetic blood and anti-serum drops for 30 seconds. Remember to
  discard each mixing stick after a single use to avoid contamination of
  your samples.
\item
  Carefully examine the thin films of liquid mixture left behind:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If a film remains uniform in appearance, there is no agglutination.
  \item
    If the sample appears granular, agglutination has occurred.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Answer yes or no as to whether agglutination occurred in each sample.
  A positive agglutination reaction indicates the blood type.
\item
  Record the results for the first blood sample in Table
  \ref{tab:blood}.
\item
  Determine the blood type of the sample using the results that you
  entered in Table \ref{tab:blood}.
\item
  Thoroughly rinse the blood-typing slide and repeat steps 1 through 7
  for synthetic blood samples 2, 3, and 4, recording the results of each
  test as you go (and rinsing the slide after each sample).
